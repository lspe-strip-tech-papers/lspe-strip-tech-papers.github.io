You have many different ways to review a paper on gihub, but my suggestion is to use the "inline issues". Once the paper is uploaded on GitHub, all the Strip members can see your `.tex` file. If you want to add a comment, fix some typos or rise a question you can:

1. Open the `.tex` file, and click on the line number that you want to comment

2. Click on the three dots, and select "Reference in new issue"

3. GitHub will open a form like that in the picture:
