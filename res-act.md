For the very early stages of the writing process, every first author can use the collaborative method that's preferred. You don't have to use (but you can!) the GitHub interface. If you are more comfortable with other tool like Overleaf, you can use them to write your paper.

## The case of Overleaf

You (and your paper-team) are free to use overleaf or any other collaborative LaTex tools that you prefer. You have to follow these few indications:

1. Use the generalized JINST template that you may find at this link:[https://github.com/lspe-strip-tech-papers/template](https://github.com/lspe-strip-tech-papers/template)
   
2. When your paper is (almost) completed, and it's time to circulate it to the community, you are strongly invited to submit your overleaf repository to our GitHub Organization.  In this way, every member of the organization can go over to your paper and suggest you change with the mechanism of the open-issues.
